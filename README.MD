# Student Grievance Management System

## Introduction
Centralised Grievance management website (add stuff later)

## Running the App
### Client App
Do the following steps to run the front side of the app. Not much is there right now and there is no backend so there isn't any validation going on

```
cd client 
npm install 
npm run dev
```

The current available endpoints are /login and /signup
Forms will be decorated later
